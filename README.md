## Description

Too many applications are out there trying to tell you how to live your life,
we wanted to come up with a way for the user to keep track of their own choices while also respecting their own intelligence!

AS A USER
I WANT to be able to create my own profile
SO THAT I can keep a daily record of my activities
I WANT to create my own list of themes
SO THAT I can hold a library of things that matter to me
I WANT to be able to grade these themes on a scale of 1-5  
SO THAT I can keep a record over time of how I feel I have reached my goals
